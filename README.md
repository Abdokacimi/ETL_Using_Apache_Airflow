# Scenario
You are a data engineer at a data analytics consulting company. You have been assigned to a project that aims to de-congest the national highways by analyzing the road traffic data from different toll plazas. Each highway is operated by a different toll operator with a different IT setup that uses different file formats. Your job is to collect data available in different formats and consolidate it into a single file.

## Objectives
